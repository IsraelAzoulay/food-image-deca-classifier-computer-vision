# Food Image Deca (10 Classes) Classifier - Computer Vision
This repository contains a project focused on classifying images of 10 different food classes using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The project leverages transfer learning and fine-tuning with TensorFlow to achieve a high accuracy of **90%** on the full test set. The implementation is carried out on Google Colab for efficient computation and easy accessibility.
